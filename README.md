# Machine Learning Foundations

A series I'm writing for myself and for students. Some of what we call "machine learning" has been part of science & statistics for a *very* long time. ;-)  

[Part Ia: "Following Gravity" (Regression via Gradient Descent)](https://github.com/drscotthawley/machinelearningfoundations/blob/master/Ia-FollowingGravity.ipynb)

*Part Ib: "Fitting in with the Locals" (Data Segmentation & Extrapolation) -- not finished yet*

*Part II: "Delay Gratification" -- not finished yet*
